# get-to-know-git-sandbox
Sandbox for presentation on working with Git

### Things to Try

#### Basic Workflow
* Fetch the latest changes
  - Maybe theres nothing, but you'll never know until you peak
* Pull the latest changes
  - Actually get those changes someone else made that you peaked in the fetch
* Add a new file
  - Create file and put it in this repo
  - Mark it to be committed, if it isn't already
  - Add a commit messsage
  - Commit!
* Change an existing file
  - Adjust an existing file. Maybe the one you just added
  - Mark it to be committed, if it isn't already
  - Add a commit messsage
  - Commit!
* Push your changes to GitHub
  - Pull to make sure you're up to date
  - Push to upload your commits

#### Branching Workflow
* Make a Branch
* Switch between branches
  - Best practice is to not have local changes, but they can be stashed or brought over to the new branch if needed. No guarentees that the changes will work smoothly!
* Commit changes to your branch
  - Same as before, but make sure you've selected the branch you want them to be committed to.
* Merge a Branch
  - Done with the branch? Merge it back into the main branch
  - Switch to the main branch
  - Merge the other branch in (we usually do a "commit merge" if your gui gives options)
  - Push to upload your new merged commit
  - You can now delete your local branch. Usually, you'll want to delete the remote one as well.
